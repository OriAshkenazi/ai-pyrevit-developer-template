Iteration Summary Code-Tasks (use with gpt-5.2)
----------------------------------------------
{ANALYSIS_OUTPUT}

Based on this technical analysis, generate remediation Code-Tasks to complete {FEATURE_NAME} implementation. Follow the Code-Task format below.

Task Generation Criteria:
* Address specific gaps identified in analysis
* Maintain 3-hour scope limitation per task
* Reference CodexWorkspace/workspace/development.md for context consistency
* Include documentation synchronization as part of each task
* Specify validation requirements
* Use Revit 2023 patterns (explicit transactions, .NET collections at API boundaries)

Code-Task Format:

Task [N]: [Action Verb] [Component/Feature] ([Development Route])

Parallel Development Note: [Why this task can run concurrently]

Context
[Brief background from CodexWorkspace/workspace/development.md and current repo state]

Objective
[Single, clear sentence describing the main goal]

Technical Requirements
1. [Primary Component] - [Specific implementation details with examples]
2. [Integration Points] - [How this connects to existing code]
3. [Data/API Specifications] - [Exact formats or interfaces]
4. [Error Handling] - [Expected failures and responses]

Files to Create/Modify
* [exact/file/path.py] - [Purpose and main responsibilities]
* [another/file/path.js] - [Specific changes required]
* [test/file/path_test.py] - [Testing requirements]

Implementation Specifications
[Detailed technical specs with code examples where helpful]

Success Criteria
* [Specific, measurable outcome 1]
* [Specific, measurable outcome 2]
* [Specific, measurable outcome 3]
* All tests pass: [specific test command]

Documentation Updates Required
* Update README.md section [X] with [specific changes]
* Update AGENTS.md with [new patterns/conventions]
* Create/update docstrings for all new functions
* Update API documentation if applicable

Validation Commands
bash
[specific test commands]
[linting commands]
[integration test commands]

Constraints
