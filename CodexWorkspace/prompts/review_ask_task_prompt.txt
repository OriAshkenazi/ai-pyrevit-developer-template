Review Ask-Task (use with gpt-5.2)
---------------------------------
Create a technical review ask-task for the {FEATURE_NAME} implementation to identify gaps and inconsistencies, following the Ask-Task format below.

Analysis Focus:
* Implementation completeness against CodexWorkspace/docs/workspace/development.md specifications
* Code consistency with established patterns
* Documentation synchronization with implementation
* Integration points and potential conflicts
* Testing coverage adequacy
* Revit 2023 API usage correctness (explicit transactions, .NET collections, no obsolete API calls)

Output Requirements:
* Technical findings only - no code generation
* Specific file and line references where applicable
* Prioritized recommendations
* Token-efficient analysis

Ask-Task Format:

Analysis Task: [Analysis Type] for [Component/Feature]

Analysis Objective
[Clear statement of what needs to be analyzed]

Focus Areas
1. [Technical Aspect 1] - [Specific elements to examine]
2. [Technical Aspect 2] - [Particular concerns or validation points]
3. [Technical Aspect 3] - [Integration or consistency checks]

Scope Definition
* Files to Review: [Specific file patterns or directories]
* Integration Points: [Systems or components to validate against]
* Reference Standards: [CodexWorkspace/docs/workspace/development.md sections, coding standards, or patterns]
* Exclusions: [What NOT to analyze]

Analysis Methodology
* Compare implementation against CodexWorkspace/docs/workspace/development.md
* Validate consistency with existing patterns
* Check integration points and dependencies
* Assess completeness against requirements

Output Requirements
Format: Technical findings report with specific file/line references
Required Sections:
1. Completeness Assessment - Missing implementations vs specifications
2. Consistency Analysis - Deviations from established patterns
3. Integration Validation - Compatibility with existing systems
4. Quality Assessment - Code quality, testing, documentation
5. Recommendations - Prioritized list of required actions

Constraints
* Technical focus only - no code generation
* Specific file/function references where applicable
* Prioritized recommendations

Context References
* Primary reference: CodexWorkspace/docs/workspace/development.md sections [X, Y, Z]
* Code patterns: [reference files or examples]
* Integration standards: [API docs or interface specs]

Success Criteria
* All specified focus areas analyzed
* Specific recommendations provided
* File/line references included for issues
* Prioritized action items generated

Optional:
Repository: {REPO_URL}
Development Guide: CodexWorkspace/docs/workspace/development.md
