Seed Code-Tasks (use with gpt-5.2)
---------------------------------
Based on development.md, generate as many discrete Code-Tasks as needed for the first feature in line for implementation.

Task Requirements:
* Reference development.md for architectural context
* Include documentation updates as integral requirements
* Scope limit: 3 hours per task
* Target: ~100 LoC per task
* Technical focus with minimal ambiguity
* Include validation criteria
* Use Revit 2023 patterns (explicit Transaction.Start/Commit, rollback on exceptions, .NET collections at API boundaries)
* gpt-5.2-codex will implement these tasks

Format each task exactly as follows:

Task [N]: [Action Verb] [Component/Feature] ([Development Route])

Parallel Development Note: [Why this task can run concurrently]

Context
[Brief background from development.md and current repo state]

Objective
[Single, clear sentence describing the main goal]

Technical Requirements
1. [Primary Component] - [Specific implementation details with examples]
2. [Integration Points] - [How this connects to existing code]
3. [Data/API Specifications] - [Exact formats or interfaces]
4. [Error Handling] - [Expected failures and responses]

Files to Create/Modify
* [exact/file/path.py] - [Purpose and main responsibilities]
* [another/file/path.js] - [Specific changes required]
* [test/file/path_test.py] - [Testing requirements]

Implementation Specifications
[Detailed technical specs with code examples where helpful]

Success Criteria
* [Specific, measurable outcome 1]
* [Specific, measurable outcome 2]
* [Specific, measurable outcome 3]
* All tests pass: [specific test command]

Documentation Updates Required
* Update README.md section [X] with [specific changes]
* Update AGENTS.md with [new patterns/conventions]
* Create/update docstrings for all new functions
* Update API documentation if applicable

Validation Commands
bash
[specific test commands]
[linting commands]
[integration test commands]

Constraints
* Maximum implementation time: 3 hours
* Target code volume: ~100 lines
* Must maintain backward compatibility
* Follow existing code patterns in [reference files]
