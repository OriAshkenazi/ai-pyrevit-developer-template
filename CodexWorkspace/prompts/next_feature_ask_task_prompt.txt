Next Feature Ask-Task (use with gpt-5.2)
---------------------------------------
Create an ask-task to analyze the current repository state and recommend the next logical feature implementation, following the Ask-Task format.

Analysis Scope:
* Current implementation completeness against development.md
* Available architectural foundations for extension
* Logical feature progression based on existing capabilities
* Technical dependencies and prerequisites

Output Requirements:
* Feature recommendation with technical rationale
* Repository overview from implementation perspective
* Prerequisites and dependencies assessment
* Implementation complexity estimation

Ask-Task Format:

Analysis Task: [Analysis Type] for [Component/Feature]

Analysis Objective
[Clear statement of what needs to be analyzed]

Focus Areas
1. [Technical Aspect 1] - [Specific elements to examine]
2. [Technical Aspect 2] - [Particular concerns or validation points]
3. [Technical Aspect 3] - [Integration or consistency checks]

Scope Definition
* Files to Review: [Specific file patterns or directories]
* Integration Points: [Systems or components to validate against]
* Reference Standards: [development.md sections, coding standards, or patterns]
* Exclusions: [What NOT to analyze]

Analysis Methodology
* Compare implementation against development.md
* Validate consistency with existing patterns
* Check integration points and dependencies
* Assess completeness against requirements

Output Requirements
Format: Technical findings report with specific file/line references
Required Sections:
1. Completeness Assessment - Missing implementations vs specifications
2. Consistency Analysis - Deviations from established patterns
3. Integration Validation - Compatibility with existing systems
4. Quality Assessment - Code quality, testing, documentation
5. Recommendations - Prioritized list of required actions

Constraints
* Technical focus only - no code generation
* Specific file/function references where applicable
* Prioritized recommendations

Success Criteria
* All specified focus areas analyzed
* Specific recommendations provided
* File/line references included for issues
* Prioritized action items generated

Optional:
Repository: {REPO_URL}
Development Guide: {development.md}
