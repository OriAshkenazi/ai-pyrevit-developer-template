# Prompt Snippets

Use these as copy/paste starters in Codex sessions to keep output consistent and aligned with the Revit 2023 patterns in `CodexWorkspace/docs/reference/`.

- `generate_code.txt` — ask for an implementation with explicit API choices, transactions, and containers.
- `review_optimize.txt` — ask for code review with performance + correctness focus.
- `document_command.txt` — ask for docstrings/user-facing documentation for a pyRevit command.
