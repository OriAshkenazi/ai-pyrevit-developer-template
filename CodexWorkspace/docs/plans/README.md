# Plans (Template)

This folder is intentionally minimal in the template.
Add project-specific planning docs here.

## How To Use
1. Copy `plan_template.md` to a new file (for example: `my_tool_plan.md`).
2. Fill it out in plain language.
3. Use gpt-5.2 with `CodexWorkspace/prompts/planning_phase_prompt.txt` to produce `development.md`.
